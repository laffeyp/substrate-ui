"""Session registry — the daemon-side name index + manifest catalog (sprint 211).

Piece C per TECH-SPEC-2026-08-25-round6 §5. Named standing sessions are the
daily-driver's identity: `substrate chat --name reviewer` opens a persistent
record under `~/.substrate/sessions/<session_id>/`, and every later resume
finds it by the same name. The registry:

  - **In-memory** name → session_id + per-session `threading.Lock` map + the
    manifest for every session on disk. (The earlier draft carried an
    `asyncio.Lock` map alongside the threading one; piece-C review finding 3
    collapsed the two — every caller of `turn_sync`, delegate wire and daemon
    POST /turn handler alike, dispatches on a thread, so one primitive covers
    the invariant.)
  - **Persistent** name index at `~/.substrate/sessions/by-name.json`. Atomic
    writes under `fcntl.flock` on the file itself so a second creator with a
    colliding name gets a 409 shape, never a corrupted index.
  - **Per-session manifest** at `~/.substrate/sessions/<session_id>/manifest.json`,
    rewritten on every state change. The record is the source of truth; the
    manifest is a hint the boot scan reads to rebuild the in-memory catalog.
  - **Boot scan** walks `~/.substrate/sessions/*/`, checks each record's status
    via `api.recover_open_segment` (hot segment → `interrupted`) and read_record
    (RunFinalised present → `ended`; otherwise → `parked`), and rewrites the
    manifest status field to match reality.

Canonical home registry (WORKING_AGREEMENT.md) lists:
  - Session manifest: `~/.substrate/sessions/<session_id>/manifest.json`
  - Name → session_id index: `~/.substrate/sessions/by-name.json`
  - Session registry (in-memory): this module.

Everything material rides the record. The manifest is recoverable from the
record's `substrate.RunStarted` payload alone (`runtime.py:_manifest:452-532`);
this module keeps it as a hint so a daemon boot does not need to open every
record's writer just to enumerate what exists.
