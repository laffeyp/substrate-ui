"""Sprint 053 — live-model standing sub-agent end-to-end.

The spec (product §6, tech §5) says: a standing sub-agent is a named
session with its own record. `delegate(task, child_session_name="…")`
routes the task as that session's next `UserMessage`; the reply comes
back to the parent as a tool result.

This test drives the whole loop end-to-end against real models, with
no scripting on the parent — the parent MODEL decides to call
delegate with the right kwarg.

Setup:

  1. Reviewer session runs qwen2.5:7b-instruct (light, fast, offline)
     with a role seed pinning the identity 'REVIEWER-42' so the
     assertion has teeth.
  2. Parent session runs kimi-k2.7-code:cloud. Live probe of every
     local + cloud model on this box confirmed the local 7B tier
     omits `child_session_name` on every native tool_call attempt,
     while every cloud model (kimi, glm-5.2, deepseek-v4-pro,
     nemotron-3-super) passes it 3/3 reliably at ~1s / call. Kimi
     is the shipped daily-driver default; using it here.

Probabilistic testing note (Architect ruling 2026-08-31): this is a
different class from deterministic testing. The test drives a real
model's DECISION to include an optional kwarg. That decision can go
wrong on a given run for no reason but model-behaviour variance. If
this test flakes once in a while it does not mean the substrate wire
is broken — it means the parent model made an unusual call. Retry
before treating a red as a regression. The wire itself is proven
deterministically by the substrate-side unit tests.

Gated by `@pytest.mark.realmodel`; skipped when Ollama or the parent
model is absent."""
